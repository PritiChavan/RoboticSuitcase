# RoboticSuitcase
Create project in Ardunin using embbeded C

This project is pretty cool and exciting for users.
We also enjoy this project during code.
We learn lot from this project.
Our Goal is to Target those peoples who travelling world wide but get irritated with baggage.
We will try to reduce their efforts by using robotic suitcase.
          
                      Description
                      
Automation is the use of machines, control systems and information 
technologies to optimize productivity in the production of goods and delivery of 
services. It is the use of control systems and information technologies to reduce the 
need for human work in the production of goods and services. In the scope of 
industrialization, automation is a step beyond mechanization. In Airport, Robotic 
Suitcase moves the luggage from the check-in to the belts servicing the flights but 
a passenger need to carry his/her own luggageâ€™s from the entrance of the airport till 
the check-in into the airport with the help of conventional luggage carrying system. 
Conventional luggage carrying system is both time consuming and labor intensive. 
The proposed Robotic Suitcase for luggage carrying system can provide those 
features needed to overcome the problems mentioned above.
In order to prevent collision with obstacles, ultrasonic sensors are used to 
detect objects that may be initspath. It was decided to provide the followed person 
with a Bluetooth module in the pocket device and Bluetooth module in suitcase 
device. Accelerometer sensor presents in pocket device that would allow it to 
detect the relative direction of the person. If anyone tries to lift the suitcase, it is 
detected by proximity sensor and consequently buzzer buzzes. If suitcase is lost 
then person can find the location through mobile
